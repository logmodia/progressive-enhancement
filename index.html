        <p class="firstp">
            Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.<br/>
            They said,<br/>
            <q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q><br/>
        </p>

            The farmer said,<br/>
            <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q><br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,<br/> 
            <q class="villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q><br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            The farmer again said,<br/>
            <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q>
        </p>

        <p>
            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,<br/> 
           <q class="villagers">Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span>,</q><br/>
        </p>

        <p>
           and the farmer responded,<br/>
           <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q><br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.<br/>
            Again all the neighbors came around and said,<br/>
            <q class="villagers">Isn’t that great!</q><br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            Again, he said,<br/>
            <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q>
        </p>

            <em>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that 
            happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; 
            or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</em>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p><span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
